## the story start from console.log(window)
now window is a global object in browser if u run above code in browser consle there are lot of properties in this as u see but we start with document as we are interested in this
## you can access the document by 
**console.log(window.document)**
by this u will get the whole document i.e html document 
as this is very common so u dnt need to write window.document everytime u can just console document and u will get that
butt by first method you get many things and by this method u get only document 
we can do that by
**console.dir(document)** and u get all the other things but here we dont need all these
