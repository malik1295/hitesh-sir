## the story start from console.log(window)
now window is a global object in browser if u run above code in browser consle there are lot of properties in this as u see but we start with document as we are interested in this
## you can access the document by 
**console.log(window.document)**
by this u will get the whole document i.e html document 
as this is very common so u dnt need to write window.document everytime u can just console document and u will get that
butt by first method you get many things and by this method u get only document 
we can do that by
**console.dir(document)** and u get all the other things but here we dont need all these
now the most important thing is to understand this document object . what it contains how many childs it have how many siblings of these childs are there in it .**Understanding this document object is very important for DOM**
## accessing div, heading,paragraph or any tag is possible if u know the **id** or **class** it contained
for this we use different methods we see all these one by one
