# javscript and classes
-javascript does have clases.This feature was introdused with ECMAscript2015 specification.HOWEVER javascript is primarily ==>>PROTOTYPE-BASED<<== language and its classes are primarily syntactic sugur over existing prototype-based inheritense mechanism.In other words it provides more famliar syntax for develpors comming from class based languages such as java or c++, but under the hood it works somewhat differently.
# OOP
# object
==>>collection op properties and methods 
methods or functions such as toLowerCase etc.
# why use OOP
## parts of OOP
==>> Object literals
==>> Constructor function
==>> Prototypes

2.Encapsulation==>wrapup data 
3.Inheritance==> 
4.Polymorphism ==>one methods do many works
